This was a project I took on in my spare time to help with converting between different number systems when I had Computer Architecture. 

First, the user will be asked to specify the base of the number system that will serve as the original base. Next, the user will be asked to input the base that will be converted to. 

The user will then input as a string the number that will be converted. Right now, the program does not accept negative or fractional inputs.
